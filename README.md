# autocheck
This is an auto check-in app whose purpose is to mark me in classes automaticaly at my university website, because I don't want to bother myself with this kind of stuff.

It runs on Railway server according to schedule, using flask and selenuim.
I made it to run selenium part of the code before flask app is started, because I haven't figured out how to run my selenium code on a running flask server without sending request to it.
If someone can help me with this issue I'll be grateful. 


I hope that nothing gonna break 'cause I'm tired of doing it.
